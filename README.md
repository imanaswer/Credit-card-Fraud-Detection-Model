# Credit-card-Fraud-Detection-Model
Detect Fraudulent Credit Card transactions using different Machine Learning models and compare performances
# Fraud Detection Model Comparison

This project compares the performance of three different machine learning models for fraud detection on a credit card transaction dataset. The models compared are:

1. **Neural Network (NN)**
2. **XGBoost (XGB)**
3. **LightGBM (LGBM)**

## Dataset

The dataset used is the [Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=credit+card+fraud), which contains transactions made by credit cards. Each transaction is labeled as either fraudulent or not.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need Python and the following libraries. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm matplotlib seaborn
```
